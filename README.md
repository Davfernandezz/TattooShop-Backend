## Description📚
This project consists of the recreation of a tattoo studio in which users will be able to register in the application, log in and access their personal area. Within their area, they will be able to view a list of scheduled appointments for tattoo and piercing services, as well as create new appointments for various services offered by the studio, such as:

- **Custom Tattoos**:
Clients will have the freedom to select unique motifs and designs, completely customizing their tattoo experience according to their preferences and tastes.
- **Tattoos from the catalog**:
We offer tattoos based on predefined designs in our catalog. Customers can choose from a variety of stylish and proven options.
- **Restoration and rejuvenation of works**:
We specialize in the restoration and rejuvenation of existing tattoos. Our experts work to improve and renew old tattoos, restoring their vitality.
- **Placement of piercings and dilators**: 
We offer professional services for the placement of piercings and dilators. Our team ensures safe procedures and varied styles to meet individual preferences of our clients.
- **Sale of piercings and other items**:
In addition to our application services, we offer a selection of piercings and other body art related items. Customers can purchase quality products for complement your unique style.

## Objetive🎯
The objective of this project is to adapt to the work done by TypeScript together with relational databases and learn to get along with Express JS, Node, Bcrypt and Jsonwebtoken. 
With the tools I just mentioned, I have completed a list of endpoints, migrations, models and seeders, taking into account different roles with their respective permissions.
